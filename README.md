# Tail Index Estimation for Degree Sequences of Complex Networks

## Script Summary

This script provides a set of tools to estimate tail index of degree distribution of complex networks. Calculated estimates can be then plotted along with PDF/CCDF of degree distribution. 

## Installation

This script does not require installation. Simply download 'tail_estimation.py' for your Python version (2 or 3) from the corresponding directory at this repository.

## Dependencies

This script requires several packages to be installed:
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Implemented Estimators

Currently several classical estimators for tail index estimation are implemented:
* Hill estimator, including smoothed Hill estimator and adjusted Hill estimator;
* moments estimator;
* Pickands estimator;
* kernel-type estimator.
